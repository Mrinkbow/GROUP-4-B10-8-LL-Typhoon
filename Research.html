    <h1> Research </h1>    
    <p> According to the document that was written by a Senior Specialist of the National Disaster Management Authority of India, that the need of right and accurate information in the right time has never been change, as people still find these type of information useful in a tough situation or a dilemma like would be a typhoon, and further more Philippines' CMFR  Center for Media Freedom Responsibility point out the values and information of journalist and media on providing typhoon related information, such as preparedness, aftermath of the typhoon, categories of the typhoon, etc. This shows that this prototype will be very effective on providing preparedness to the people before, during, and after typhoons. Gathering Information

Instructions: Use the steps of Basic Research to gather information and material references on the impacts of the typhoon assigned to your group. As you gather information, you may refer to the following guide questions:

What is the basic information about our typhoon (This includes the wind speed, the amount of 

precipitation brought, when and where it occurred, etc.)

Category: Category 3 Typhoon (111-129 mph) 

Formed: October 8, 2013

Dissipated: on October 16, 2013

Precipitation: 7.5 - 30.0 mm per hour 

Countries/Areas affected: Philippines, Vietnam, 

Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.

What is the basic information of the region that has been greatly affected by the typhoon (This includes the geographical location, economic status, population, etc.)?

Geographical Location: 

The geographical locations of these specific regions are very prone to typhoons due to being near the ocean, additionally, the Philippines is part of the pacific ring of Fire where volcanoes and earthquakes are more prone in this area.

Economic Status The economic status of these countries is decent, with countries ranging being 3rd world to 2nd world countries, additionally, all of them do have large debts. 

Population:

The population of these countries combined up to more than 300 million people.

How was the community affected by the typhoon?

They were affected especially in the agricultural and fishery sectors in the Philippines as one of the instances where 2.9 billion pesos worth of damages occurred in Nueva Ecija, Aurora

How did the community prepare for it? How did they recover?

They prepared by practicing safety from floods due to it being very common and they recovered from it with their economic plan and provided safety and food with programs

How vulnerable are they to typhoons?

Very vulnerable due to being surrounded by large bodies of water like the PacificOceann

Were there any damages? How severe they were?

It was very dire, over 747,353 (154,766 families) people were affected, and damaged homes totaled 151

Were there any positive impacts of the typhoon in the region? What are those?

It relieves drought and regulated heat in communities, and it rose an important value to Filipinos which is Bayanihan

II. Mitigating the Impacts of Typhoons

Instructions: Perform the steps of basic research to find steps in mitigating the impact of typhoons. Recall the Design Thinking Process to develop solutions for minimizing the impacts of typhoons. Document your brainstorming tools, such as your mind maps, diagrams, 5 whys, and the identified solution below.
